# Prediction_of_Plant_species_in_neighborhood

In this Project I am predicting the plant species according to the geographical data using Machine learning.

Machine learning algorithms used: K-nearest neighbors, Random Forest, Decision Trees.

K-nearest neighbors : K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is one of the simplest algorithms used in Machine Learning for regression and 
classification problem. KNN algorithms use data and classify new data points based on similarity measures (e.g. distance function). 
Classification is done by a majority vote to its neighbors.

Random Forest: Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other 
tasks that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of 
the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random decision forests correct for 
decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.

Decision trees: Decision Trees learning is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning.
It uses a decision tree (as a predictive model) to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions 
about the item's target value (represented in the leaves).
